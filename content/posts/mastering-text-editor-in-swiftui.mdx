One of the most commonly used views in iOS apps is an editable text view. It's a versatile element that can be used for various purposes: leave a comments on social media, create a note, or even write a code. SwiftUI has a basic view for long-form text editing - `TextEditor`. While it is not as powerful as `UITextView`, it is sufficient for most use cases.

In this article, we'll explore the basic features of `TextEditor` and how to extend it with additional functionality. This is the first article in a series on text editing in SwiftUI. Next, we'll cover more topics like text classification and creating your own machine learning model for text analysis. Text is not just symbols, right?

## Basic requirements

Let's start with the basic requirements for text editing:

- Focus management. It's important to show the keyboard when the text editor appears and hide it when the user finishes editing;
- Characters limit. Sometimes you need to limit the number of characters in the text editor. For instance, in most cases X has a limit of 280 characters for tweets;
- Reading and editing mode. Read-only mode is useful for displaying text that can't be edited, but can be selected and copied.

Unlike `Text`, `TextEditor` doesn't support attributed strings or markdown. And we'll not cover it in this article.

## Base configuration

Let's begin with the initial setup. `TextEditor` requires a binding to a string:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {

    @State private var text = "It was a great day!"

    var body: some View {
        TextEditor(text: $text)
    }
}
```
Starting from iOS 18.0, text selection can be handled directly. This feature can be useful for offering text suggestions. For instance, you can suggest to change text with LLM like GPT-4o: adjust the length, change reading level, etc.

```swift
@State private var textSelection: TextSelection?

TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  .onChange(of: textSelection) {
      guard let textSelection else {
          return
      }
      switch textSelection.indices {
      case .selection(let range):
        print(text[range])
      case .multiSelection(let rangeSet):
          rangeSet.ranges.forEach { range in
              print(text[range])
          }
      @unknown default:
          break
      }
  }
```

To change the background color, hide the scroll content background and apply a new color.:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  .scrollContentBackground(.hidden)
  .background(.gray.tertiary)
```

Also, based on design of your app, you can change the font, text color, and line spacing:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  .font(.title3)
  .foregroundStyle(.primary)
  .lineSpacing(4)
```

Depending on text content, you can change the keyboard:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  // Change a keyboard layout based on types
  .keyboardType(.default)
  // Change return key type
  .submitLabel(.return)
```

By default, iOS automatically changes the text input with autocapitalization and autocorrection. It may be annoying sometimes, for example, when you enter an address or technical terms. You can control this behavior:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  .textInputAutocapitalization(.sentences)
  .autocorrectionDisabled(true)
```

## Focus State

The `focused` modifier allows us to manage the focus state of the text editor. For example, if you may show the keyboard on appearance or hide it on saving action.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @State private var text = "It was a great day!"
    @State private var textSelection: TextSelection?
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool // [!code highlight]

    var body: some View {
        TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
            .focused($isFocused) // [!code highlight]
            .onAppear {
                isFocused = true // [!code highlight]
            }
    }
}
```

## Characters limit

There is no built-in way to limit the number of characters in `TextEditor`. But we can use `onChange` modifier to check the text length and truncate it if it exceeds the limit:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  .characterLimit($text, to: 200)

extension View {

    func characterLimit(_ text: Binding<String>, to limit: Int) -> some View {
        onChange(of: text.wrappedValue) {
            text.wrappedValue = String(text.wrappedValue.prefix(limit))
        }
    }
}
```

This code is simple and requires no additional states or bindings. We can track the text count and show `ProgressView` to indicate the remaining characters:

```swift
VStack(spacing: 0) {
    ProgressView(value: Float(text.count), total: 200)
    TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
}
```

## Find and replace

One of specific modifiers for text editing is `findNavigator`. It allows you to add find and replace features to the text:

```swift
@State private var findNavigatorIsPresented = false

var body: some View {
    TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
      .findNavigator(isPresented: $findNavigatorIsPresented)
}
```

![Find and replace](/images/using-text-editor-in-swiftui/find-and-replace.png)

To enable this interface, we can add a toolbar item with a toggle:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $selection)
    .toolbar {
        ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .keyboard) {
            Toggle(isOn: $findNavigatorIsPresented) {
                Label("Find and replace", systemImage: "magnifyingglass")
            }
        }
    }
```

Optionally you can disable it for some cases:
    
```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $selection)
  // Disables find and replace features
  .findDisabled(true)
  // Disables only replacing feature
  .replaceDisabled(true)
```

These modifiers must be added before the `.findNavigator` modifier. Otherwise, they will have no effect.

## Reading and editing mode

That's what stops me from using `TextEditor` sometimes - it doesn't have a built-in way to disable editing. The first thing that comes to mind is to show `Text` instead of `TextEditor` in read-only mode. It may be useful but users can select only the full text, not a part of it. An other way to disable editing is to use `.constant(text)` binding. However, the keyboard and cursor still appear when tapping, which is undesirable. 

Here is a workaround with [Introspect](https://github.com/siteline/swiftui-introspect) framework:

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  .introspect(.textEditor, on: .iOS(.v18)) { textView in
      textView.isEditable = false
  }
```

## Apple Intelligence and Writing Tools

Apple introduced a feature called Writing Tools. It's a set of tools that help users to write smarter:

  width="100%"
  height="315"
  src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3m0MoYKwVTM"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

`TextEditor` supports Writing Tools by default. There is a new modifier `writingToolsBehavior` that allows you to change the behavior. For example, `.complete` behavior completes current phrase.

```swift
TextEditor(text: $text, selection: $textSelection)
  .writingToolsBehavior(.complete)
```

I didn't find a way to run Writing Tools in the simulator, and my iPhone 14 Pro doesn't support it. So I just ran the example on macOS:

## TextEditor alternatives

Thinking about alternatives to `TextEditor`, we can consider:

- `TextField` with vertical axis (iOS 16.0+);
- Third-party frameworks like [RichTextKit](https://github.com/danielsaidi/RichTextKit) or [STTextView](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/STTextView);
- `UITextView` via `UIViewRepresentable`.

There is no perfect solution; choose the one that best fits your requirements. When writing code, I aim to achieve flexibility without adding unnecessary complexity. While it can be challenging at times, the results are always rewarding.

## What's next?

In this article, we've covered the basic features of `TextEditor`. You can find a final version of the code in [TextEditorExample](https://github.com/artemnovichkov/TextEditorExample) repository. But it just a beginning. What's really interesting is a meaning of the text. What users want to say? What's the sentiment? How to classify the text? We'll cover these topics in the next articles. Stay tuned!
