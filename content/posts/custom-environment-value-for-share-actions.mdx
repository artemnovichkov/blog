SwiftUI has a lot of modern and useful features. One of my favourite is @Environment property wrapper. It allows you to get system-wide settings, for instance, current locale or color scheme. Since iOS 14.0 you can use `openURL` value to open URLs from apps easily.

```swift
@available(iOS 14.0, macOS 11.0, tvOS 14.0, watchOS 7.0, *)
extension EnvironmentValues {

/// Opens a URL using the appropriate system service.

    public var openURL: OpenURLAction { get }
}
```

With just a one line of code you can extend behaviour of you views:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {

    @Environment(\.openURL) var openURL
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Share") {
            openURL(URL(string: "https://artemnovichkov.com")!)
        }
    }
}
```

I was wondering how it works under the hood and tried to implement the same trick for sharing activity items with `UIActivityViewController`. Let's check the result!

## Keys and values

At first we should create a custom key, conform to `EnvironmentKey` protocol and set a default value. It will be an empty struct for now:

```swift
struct ShareAction {}

struct ShareActionEnvironmentKey: EnvironmentKey {

    static let defaultValue: ShareAction = .init()
}
```

Next, we should extend `EnvironmentValues` to make `ourShareAction` be available from the environment:

```swift
extension EnvironmentValues {

    var share: ShareAction {
        self[ShareActionEnvironmentKey.self]
    }
}
```

The last thing is adding `callAsFunction` in `ShareAction` struct to use the same syntax:

```swift
struct ShareAction {

    func callAsFunction(_ activityItems: [Any]) {
        let vc = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: activityItems, applicationActivities: nil)
        let windowScenes = UIApplication.shared.connectedScenes
            .compactMap { $0 as? UIWindowScene }
        let activeScene = windowScenes
            .filter { $0.activationState == .foregroundActive }
        let firstActiveScene = activeScene.first
        let keyWindow = firstActiveScene?.keyWindow
        keyWindow?.rootViewController?.present(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

> Unfortunately, there is no SwiftUI-way to open this controller. If you use a better way, let me know!

To read more about callable values of user-defined nominal types, check [SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md) proposal on Github.

That's it, now we can use `.share` value and share activities from any view:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {

    @Environment(\.share) var share
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Share") {
            share([URL(string: "https://artemnovichkov.com")!])
        }
    }
}
```

## Using ShareLink

Since iOS 16.0, you can use `ShareLink` view to share activities. It's a more SwiftUI-way to share activities and it's more convenient to use.

```swift
ShareLink(item: URL(string: "https://artemnovichkov.com")!) {
    Text("Share")
}
```
