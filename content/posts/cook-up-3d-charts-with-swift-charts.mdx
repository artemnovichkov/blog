WWDC 2025 introduced new tools for data visualization in SwiftUI, and one of great additions is Chart3D. With this new API, you can now create interactive and customizable 3D charts directly in SwiftUI — no third-party libraries or complex SceneKit setups required.

In this post, I'll guide you through building 3D charts. If you're not familiar with Swift Charts, you can check my previous posts:

  The example is tested on iOS 26.0 beta with Xcode 26.0 beta (17A5241e).

## Preparing the data

As for every chart, we need data to display. We'll use a classic Iris dataset from Kaggle. It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.
The CSV file contains the following columns:

```csv
Id,SepalLengthCm,SepalWidthCm,PetalLengthCm,PetalWidthCm,Species
1,5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
...
```

Let's create a struct that will represent a single row of the dataset:

```swift
import Foundation

struct Iris: Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let sepalLength: Double
    let sepalWidth: Double
    let petalLength: Double
    let petalWidth: Double
    let species: String
}
```

To parse the data, we'll use `TabularData` framework:

```swift
import TabularData

func parseIrisData() -> [Iris] {
    let fileUrl = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "Iris", withExtension: "csv")!
    let dataFrame = try! DataFrame(contentsOfCSVFile: fileUrl)
    return dataFrame.rows.compactMap { row in
        guard let id = row["Id"] as? Int,
              let sepalLengthCm = row["SepalLengthCm"] as? Double,
              let sepalWidthCm = row["SepalWidthCm"] as? Double,
              let petalLengthCm = row["PetalLengthCm"] as? Double,
              let petalWidthCm = row["PetalWidthCm"] as? Double,
              let species = row["Species"] as? String else {
            return nil
        }
        return Iris(id: id,
                    sepalLength: sepalLengthCm,
                    sepalWidth: sepalWidthCm,
                    petalLength: petalLengthCm,
                    petalWidth: petalWidthCm,
                    species: species)
    }
}
```

## Creating the chart

Let's create an empty chart and parse the data:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Charts

struct ContentView: View {

    @State private var irisData: [Iris] = []

    var body: some View {
        Chart3D {
        }
        .onAppear {
            irisData = parseIrisData()
        }
    }
}
```

At the moment, `Chart3D` supports 3 types of marks:

- PointMark;
- RuleMark;
- RectangleMark.

We'll use `PointMark` that will represent a single point in 3D space. Since iOS 26.0 beta, we can use a new initializer with three values:

```swift
Chart3D(irisData) { iris in
    PointMark(
        x: .value("Petal Length", iris.petalLength),
        y: .value("Petal Width", iris.petalWidth),
        z: .value("Sepal Length", iris.sepalLength)
    )
}
```

The dataset has 4 parameters, but we'll show only 3 of them.

## Customizing the chart

We can customize scale of the chart by modifier for every axis:

```swift
.chartXScale(domain: 1...8, range: -1.5...1.5)
.chartYScale(domain: 0...3, range: -0.5...0.5)
// New in iOS 26.0 beta
.chartZScale(domain: 4...8, range: -0.5...0.5)
```

I chose these values to increase the size of the chart. We can also set axis labels to make the chart more readable:

```swift
private let xLabel = "Petal Length (cm)"
private let yLabel = "Petal Width (cm)"
private let zLabel = "Sepal Length (cm)"

Chart3D {}
.chartXAxisLabel(xLabel)
.chartYAxisLabel(yLabel)
// New in iOS 26.0 beta
.chartZAxisLabel(zLabel)
```

The interesting thing here is that we can't set string literals directly, the labels won't be displayed. It looks like a bug for me, but I found this workaround in Code section of related WWDC session. I'll check it in next betas and update this post if needed.

There are also some unique modifiers for 3D charts. `chart3DCameraProjection` modifier allows to change the projection of the chart:

```swift
.chart3DCameraProjection(.perspective)
```
The default projection is `.orthographic`, we can change it to `.perspective` to emphasize depth of the chart:

![Perspective](/images/cook-up-3d-charts-with-swift-charts/perspective.png)

You may notice that some points are grouped together. We can change the foreground style of point marks to highlight the species:

```swift
PointMark(...)
.foregroundStyle(by: .value("Species", iris.species))
```

By default, the symbol is a sphere. We can change it to other shapes and sizes:

```swift
PointMark(...)
.symbol(.cube) // can be a sphere, cylinder, cone, or cube
.symbolSize(0.05)
```

## Changing the position

The perspective of 3D charts is very important. It allows to see the chart from different angles and emphasize the depth of the chart. With a new `chart3DPose` modifier we can change the position of the chart. You can use one of the predefined poses:

```swift
Chart3D {}
.chart3DPose(.front)
```

![Pose](/images/cook-up-3d-charts-with-swift-charts/pose.png)

You can also create your own pose by using `Chart3DPose` struct:

```swift
.chart3DPose(Chart3DPose(azimuth: .degrees(0), inclination: .degrees(20)))
```

Azimuth controls horizontal rotation; inclination controls vertical rotation.

Adding a binding to the pose state allows to change the position of the chart by user interaction:

```swift
@State private var pose = Chart3DPose(azimuth: .degrees(0), inclination: .degrees(20))

Chart3D {}
.chart3DPose($pose)
```

Now you can change the position of the chart by dragging your finger on the chart.

We can also change the pose automatically to create an animation:

```swift
// Required import for Angle2D
import Spatial

@State private var pose = Chart3DPose(azimuth: .degrees(0), inclination: .degrees(20))
@State private var azimuthAngle: Angle2D = .degrees(0)
private let timer = Timer.publish(every: 0.03, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()

Chart3D {}
.chart3DPose($pose)
.onReceive(timer) { _ in
    azimuthAngle += .degrees(1)
    if azimuthAngle.degrees >= 360 {
        azimuthAngle = .degrees(0)
    }
    pose = Chart3DPose(azimuth: azimuthAngle, inclination: .degrees(20))
}
```

`Chart3DPose` has no `azimuth` property, so we need to store azimuth angle in a separate state. And here is the result:

/>

## Conclusion

The new Chart3D in SwiftUI opens new possibilities for data visualization. Whether you're plotting scientific data or interactive dashboards, 3D charts add depth — literally and visually — to your app. 

Moreover, if you're developing a visionOS app, you can use Chart3D to visualize the data as well.
