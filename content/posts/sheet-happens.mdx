Developing pet projects is one of the best ways to learn new things. Since SwiftUI 1.0 I've been writing an app for saving and reading articles. I rewrote it twice from scratch, added and removed features based on my user experience, used new APIs, etc.

I had a few interesting cases implementing modal views a.k.a. sheets in SwiftUI. The main goal of this article is to summarize my experience and use it as a reference for the future. I simplify code examples to focus on specific logic. Let's start with showing.

> Note: Examples are written in Swift 5.3.2 and work on iOS 14.0 with Xcode 12.4 (12D4e).

## Showing sheets

There are two options for showing sheets. 

The first one is based on `Binding<Bool>` value. It can be stored via `@State` property wrapper and good for sheets that need no external data:

```swift
struct ArticlesView: View {

    @State var isSettingsViewPresented = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Settings") {
            isSettingsViewPresented = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $isSettingsViewPresented) {
            SettingsView()
        }
    }
}

struct SettingsView: View {

    var body: some View {
        Text("Settings")
    }
}
```

The second one is based on `Binding<Item?>` value where the item is an optional Identifiable object. it's a good choice if we want to pass any data to sheets. For instance, a selected article for reading. Pay attention that the selected article is not optional in sheet content closure:

```swift
// A simple struct with article data

struct Article: Identifiable {

    let id: UUID
    let title: String
}

struct ArticlesView: View {

    @State var article: Article?
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Article") {
            article = .init(id: .init(), title: "Awesome article")
        }
        .sheet(item: $article) { article in
            ArticleDetailsView(article: article)
        }
    }
}

// A view for article showing

struct ArticleDetailsView: View {

    @State var article: Article
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(article.title)
    }
}
```

**An interesting moments:**

- if `id` of the selected article will be changed, the presented sheet will be dismissed and replaced with a new sheet;
- if the selected article becomes nil at any moment, the sheet will be dismissed as well. 

For both showing options we can optionally add `onDismiss` closure that executed when the sheet dismisses:

```swift
struct ArticlesView: View {

    @State var article: Article?
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Article") {
            article = .init(id: .init(), title: "Awesome article")
        }
        .sheet(item: $article, onDismiss: onDismiss) { article in
            ArticleDetailsView(article: article)
        }
    }
       
    private func onDismiss() {
        print("dismisses")
    }
}
```

By default, we can dismiss sheets via swipe gestures. But what if we want to dismiss sheets based on another user action or app logic?

## Dismissing sheets

There are two options to dismiss sheets too. If we use `Binding<Bool>`, we can pass it to a sheet via `@Binding` property wrapper and update its value. Bindings allow to change values in parent views:

```swift
// in ArticlesView

.sheet(isPresented: $isSettingsViewPresented) {
    SettingsView(isSettingsViewPresented: $isSettingsViewPresented)
}

struct SettingsView: View {
    
    @Binding var isSettingsViewPresented: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Text("Settings")
            VStack {
                Spacer()
                Button("Dismiss") {
                    isSettingsViewPresented = false
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Another option is more universal and based on `presentationMode` environment:

```swift
struct SettingsView: View {
    
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Text("Settings")
            VStack {
                Spacer()
                Button("Dismiss") {
                    presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This environment indicates whether a view is currently presented by another view.

## Sheets and ForEach

The app with only one article is a bit useless, so let's create List and make articles rows via `ForEach`:

```swift
struct ArticlesView: View {

    let articles: [Article] = [.init(id: .init(), title: "Awesome article"),
                               .init(id: .init(), title: "Another awesome article")]
    @State var isArticleDetailsViewPresented: Bool = false
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                ForEach(articles) { article in
                    Text(article.title)
                        .onTapGesture {
                            isArticleDetailsViewPresented = true
                        }
                        .sheet(isPresented: $isArticleDetailsViewPresented) {
                            ArticleDetailsView(article: article)
                        }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Articles")
        }
    }
}
```

Here we use `Binding<Bool>` for sheet state and update its value on tap action. Because we have the articles in enumeration, we can pass it to `ArticleDetailsView`. Everything looks fine, the app builds successfully. But `ArticleDetailsView` presents only with `"Awesome article"` title for the first article. Ok, remember this case and try to update sheets logic in the next article section after another example.

## Multiple sheets

Previously we used one sheet for the selected article. In my app, I show different views according to the internet connection. If the internet is available, I show `SafariView` with the url of the selected article, and WebArchiveView with saved web archive data.

At first, we update our models:

```swift
struct Article: Identifiable {

    let id: UUID
    let title: String
    let url: URL
}

extension URL: Identifiable {
    
    public var id: String {
        absoluteString
    }
}

extension String: Identifiable {
    
    public var id: String {
        self
    }
}
```

URL and String types must conform `Identifiable` protocol for using in sheet bindings.

Next, we update ArticlesView with multiple sheets. To simplify the example let's show different views based on Bool state:

```swift
struct ArticlesView: View {

    let article: Article = .init(id: .init(),
                                 title: "Sheet happens",
                                 url: URL(string: "https://blog.artemnovichkov.com/editor/sheet-happens")!)
    
    @State var url: URL?
    @State var title: String?
    @State var isOn = true
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Button("Show Article") {
                if isOn {
                    url = article.url
                }
                else {
                    title = article.title
                }
            }
            .sheet(item: $url) { url in
                SafariView(url: url)
            }
            .sheet(item: $title) { title in
                WebArchiveView(title: title)
            }
            Toggle("", isOn: $isOn)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

Finally, we add views with different states and body content:

```swift
struct SafariView: View {
    
    @State var url: URL
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Content of " + url.absoluteString)
    }
}

struct WebArchiveView: View {
    
    @State var title: String
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Web archive data of \(title) article")
    }
}
```

Here we have another strange behavior â€” only `WebArchiveView` will be shown. It's a known issue in SwiftUI, but don't give up, let's fix it!

## Fixing multiple sheets

We create `Sheet` enum with cases for every sheet. It must conform `Identifiable` as well:

```swift
enum Sheet: Identifiable {
    
    case url(URL)
    case webArchive(String)
    
    var id: String {
        switch self {
        case .url(let url):
            return url.id
        case .webArchive(let title):
            return title.id
        }
    }
}
```

In `ArticlesView` we replace states with only one with `Sheet` value and use one `sheet` modifier:

```swift
struct ArticlesView: View {

    let article: Article = .init(id: .init(),
                                 title: "Sheet happens",
                                 url: URL(string: "https://blog.artemnovichkov.com/editor/sheet-happens")!)
    
    @State var sheet: Sheet?
    @State var isOn = true
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Button("Show Article") {
                if isOn {
                    sheet = .url(article.url)
                }
                else {
                    sheet = .webArchive(article.title)
                }
            }
            .sheet(item: $sheet) { sheet in
                switch sheet {
                case .url(let url):
                    SafariView(url: url)
                case .webArchive(let title):
                    WebArchiveView(title: title)
                }
            }
            Toggle("", isOn: $isOn)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

Now, with sheet state, both views will be presented ðŸŽ‰

If we want to reuse these sheets in another view, we can conform `View` protocol and return related views in body:

```swift
enum Sheet: View, Identifiable {
    
    case url(URL)
    case webArchive(String)
    
    var id: String {
        switch self {
        case .url(let url):
            return url.id
        case .webArchive(let title):
            return title.id
        }
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        switch self {
        case .url(let url):
            SafariView(url: url)
        case .webArchive(let title):
            WebArchiveView(title: title)
        }
    }
}

// in ArticlesView

.sheet(item: $sheet) { $0 }
```

The final code for the example is available [here](https://github.com/artemnovichkov/sheet).

## Updates for iOS & iPadOS 14.5 Beta 3

According to [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-14_5-beta-release-notes), we can now apply multiple `sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)` and f`ullScreenCover(item:onDismiss:content:)` modifiers in the same view hierarchy. (74246633). But if we need to support previous versions (oh, come on, of course we need ðŸ˜€), we can use the way described above.

## Conclusion

As we can see, SwiftUI has a simple and declarative way for showing sheets with bindings magic. But in real apps with different layouts we must use it wisely and know edge cases of its behavior.
