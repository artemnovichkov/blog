Two months ago my friend [@iamnalimov](https://twitter.com/iamnalimov) and I published jstnmbr app on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jstnmbr). The idea of the app is very simple â€” count everything: books, push-ups, glasses of water. Of course, I choose SwiftUI for implementation. In this article, I want to highlight the key moments of implementing custom popups. It won't be in the tutorial format, we'll add a specific layout, but I hope it helps you in using overlays, geometry readers, and modifiers in your projects. If you have any questions or ideas on how to improve it, ping me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/iosartem).

## Design is the key

Let's start with the design. Popups may contain different content, but the appearance and behavior are the same. Superviews are covered with blur overlay, popups have the same background color, top left and right rounded corners, and ability to dismissing:

![Final design](/images/custom-popups-in-swiftui/design.png)

We want to implement a familiar API interface for presenting like alerts or action sheets:

```swift
.popup(isPresented: $isPresented) {
    popupView
}
```

Here we have a `Binding<Bool>` for presenting state and `@ViewBuilder` for popup content. Internally it will contain two parts:

- Custom ViewModifier that will show popups via overlays.
- View extension for convenience interface and blur overlays.

## Modifiers And View Extensions

Initially, we create `OverlayModifier`:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct OverlayModifier<OverlayView: View>: ViewModifier {
    
    @Binding var isPresented: Bool
    @ViewBuilder var overlayView: () -> OverlayView
    
    init(isPresented: Binding<Bool>, @ViewBuilder overlayView: @escaping () -> OverlayView) {
        self._isPresented = isPresented
        self.overlayView = overlayView
    }
}
```

It contains `isPresented` state and the popup content. To conform `ViewModifier` protocol, we must implement `body(content:)` function. In our case it just optionally adds an overlay based on the state:

```swift
func body(content: Content) -> some View {
    content.overlay(isPresented ? overlayView() : nil)
}
```

Pay attention to `overlayView()`. Its body will be called only when popups is presented. `View` knows nothing about this modifier, so we extend `View` protocol with popup presentation:

```swift
extension View {
    
    func popup<OverlayView: View>(isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
                                  blurRadius: CGFloat = 3,
                                  blurAnimation: Animation? = .linear,
                                  @ViewBuilder overlayView: @escaping () -> OverlayView) -> some View {
        blur(radius: isPresented.wrappedValue ? blurRadius : 0)
            .animation(blurAnimation)
            .allowsHitTesting(!isPresented.wrappedValue)
            .modifier(OverlayModifier(isPresented: isPresented, overlayView: overlayView))
    }
}
```

Let's describe every modifier:

1. `blur` adds a blur overlay to superview if the popup is presented. We have a default value in function parameters to reuse the same radius and modify for specific popups if needed.
2. `animation` adds an animation for blur overlay if needed.
3. `allowsHitTesting` disables user interactions in superview if the popup is presented.
4. `modifier` applies custom `OverlayModifier` with passed `overlayView`.

We're ready to show popups, but we don't have any yet ðŸ˜…. Let's make a basic PopupView with a common appearance according to our goals:
- It may contain different content inside;
- It has a background color and rounded top left and top right corners;
- It is showed from the bottom with animation.

## Popup Layout

Let's create a simple view named NamePopupView that knows nothing about popup logic:

![NamePopupView](/images/custom-popups-in-swiftui/popup-1.png)

The app may show different popups, so we create a reusable `BottomPopupView` to show different content:

```swift
struct BottomPopupView<Content: View>: View {
    
    @ViewBuilder var content: () -> Content
    
    var body: some View {
        content()
    }
}
```

Now we can show it in `.popup` modifier:

```swift
.popup(isPresented: $isPresented) {
	BottomPopupView {
		NamePopupView(isPresented: $isPresented)
	}
}
```

By default, overlays are shown in the center of the superview. To pin it to the bottom we wrap the content into `VStack` with `Spacer`:

```swift
VStack {
	Spacer()
	content()
	    .background(Color.white)
	    .cornerRadius(radius: 16, corners: [.topLeft, .topRight])
}
```

Default `cornerRadius` modifier works for all corners, so here we use a custom modifier for it:

```swift
struct RoundedCornersShape: Shape {
    
    let radius: CGFloat
    let corners: UIRectCorner
    
    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        let path = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: rect,
                                byRoundingCorners: corners,
                                cornerRadii: CGSize(width: radius, height: radius))
        return Path(path.cgPath)
    }
}

extension View {
    
    func cornerRadius(radius: CGFloat, corners: UIRectCorner = .allCorners) -> some View {
        clipShape(RoundedCornersShape(radius: radius, corners: corners))
    }
}
```

All is now ready, and here is the result:

![Popup with extra Safe Area insets](/images/custom-popups-in-swiftui/popup-2.png)

Insets for Safe Area have added automatically, but we want to overlay superviews at the bottom too. To read and use Safe Area insets, we add `GeometryReader`:

```swift
GeometryReader { geometry in
	VStack {
	    Spacer()
	    content()
		    .padding(.bottom, geometry.safeAreaInsets.bottom)
		    .background(Color.white)
		    .cornerRadius(radius: 16, corners: [.topLeft, .topRight])
	}
	.edgesIgnoringSafeArea([.bottom])
}
```

To pin our popup at the bottom, we add `.edgesIgnoringSafeArea` modifier. According to the content, we add a bottom padding with the bottom inset before `.background` modifier. With this logic background color will appear as expected.

Since iOS 14 we even have an automatic keyboard avoidance:

## Animations

The layout is finished ðŸ¥³, but there is no animation. Luckily SwiftUI has easy-to-use modifiers for animations and transitions:

```swift
GeometryReader { geometry in
    ...
}
.animation(.easeOut)
.transition(.move(edge: .bottom))
```
