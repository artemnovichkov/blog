One of the key features of SwiftUI is a declarative syntax for layout. It is available thanks to **result builders**, previously called function builders. With result builders, we can implicitly build up a final value from a sequence of components. The final revision of this feature is released in Swift 5.4, and Xcode 12.5 suggests code completions and fix-its for it. I guess it's a good sign for exploring it and making action sheets more declarative!

## Preparation

We'll create a simple SwiftUI app, where we can select ingredients for sandwich.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var ingredients: [String] = []
    @State private var isActionSheetPresented = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(ingredients.joined())
                .font(.system(.title))
            Button("Make a sandwich") {
                isActionSheetPresented = true
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .actionSheet(isPresented: $isActionSheetPresented) {
            let buttons = [ActionSheet.Button.default(Text("üçû")) {
                ingredients.append("üçû")
            },
            ActionSheet.Button.cancel()]
            return ActionSheet(title: Text("Select an ingredient"), message: nil, buttons: buttons)
        }
    }
}
```

When we tap on the button, `ActionSheet` is presented with buttons from the array in the initializer. The syntax for action buttons, especially with defined actions, looks a bit complicated. Let's improve it with a custom result builder.

## Basics

We create a `ButtonsBuilder` struct with `@resultBuilder` attribute. To start using it, we must implement at least one static `buildBlock` function:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct ButtonsBuilder {

    static func buildBlock(_ components: ActionSheet.Button...) -> [ActionSheet.Button] {
        components
    }
}
```

Here we have a variadic parameter with `ActionSheet.Button` and just return it as is.

Because `ActionSheet` knows nothing about our builder, we create a new initializer with title, message, and the builder:

```swift
extension ActionSheet {
    
    init(title: Text, message: Text? = nil, @ButtonsBuilder buttons: () -> [ActionSheet.Button]) {
        self.init(title: title, message: message, buttons: buttons())
    }
}
```

Now we're ready to refactor `ActionSheet` configuration:

```swift
.actionSheet(isPresented: $isActionSheetPresented) {
    ActionSheet(title: Text("Select an ingredient"), message: nil) {
        ActionSheet.Button.default(Text("üçû")) {
            ingredients.append("üçû")
        }
        ActionSheet.Button.cancel()
    }
}
```
Looks great!

## What if?.. Working with conditions

Result builders may build a partial result depending on some conditions. In our app, we add a new `State` and `Toggle`. If it is enabled, we add cucumbers and tomatoes otherwise. 

```swift
// In States section
@State private var likeCucumbers = true

// Below Text in ContentView
Toggle("I love cucumbers", isOn: $likeCucumbers)
```

To support `if-else` conditions in our builder, we must implement `buildEither(first:)` and `buildEither(second:)` functions:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct ButtonsBuilder {
    
    ...
    
    static func buildEither(first components: [ActionSheet.Button]) -> [ActionSheet.Button] {
        components
    }
    
    static func buildEither(second components: [ActionSheet.Button]) -> [ActionSheet.Button] {
        components
    }
}
```

If we try to add `if-else` statement like this:

```swift
if likeCucumbers {
	ActionSheet.Button.default(Text("ü•í")) {
		ingredients.append("ü•í")
	}
}
else {
	ActionSheet.Button.default(Text("üçÖ")) {
		ingredients.append("üçÖ")
	}
}
```

We have an error:

> Cannot pass array of type '[ActionSheet.Button]' (aka 'Array<Alert.Button>') as variadic arguments of type 'ActionSheet.Button' (aka 'Alert.Button')

We can solve the error by defining a new protocol and implementing it by both a single `ActionSheet.Button` and a collection of `ButtonsConvertible`:

```swift
protocol ButtonsConvertible {
    
    var buttons: [ActionSheet.Button] { get }
}

extension ActionSheet.Button: ButtonsConvertible {
    
    var buttons: [ActionSheet.Button] {
        [self]
    }
}

extension Array: ButtonsConvertible where Element == ButtonsConvertible {

    var buttons: [ActionSheet.Button] { self.flatMap(\.buttons) }
}
```

In `ButtonsBuilder` we replace all `ActionSheet.Button` with `ButtonsConvertible`. And finally, we implement `buildFinalResult` function that gets all `ButtonsConvertible` and maps it to buttons:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct ButtonsBuilder {
    
    static func buildBlock(_ components: ButtonsConvertible...) -> [ButtonsConvertible] {
        components
    }
    
    ...
    
    static func buildFinalResult(_ components: [ButtonsConvertible]) -> [ActionSheet.Button] {
        components.flatMap(\.buttons)
    }
}
```

Now `likeCucumbers` check builds successfully.

## Using ForEach for Actions

SwiftUI has an awesome `ForEach` element. It gets different data collections and converts them to views via `@ViewBuilder`. I was wondering if there is any chance to use it for buttons ü§î. Of course, let's start with an extension:

```swift
extension ForEach: ButtonsConvertible where Content == ActionSheet.Button {

    var buttons: [ActionSheet.Button] {
        data.map(content)
    }
}
```

Here we declare that `Content` generic must be `ActionSheet.Button` and map data to buttons via `content` closure.

`ActionSheet.Button` is a simple typealias for `Alert.Button`, and `Alert.Button` is just a struct that doesn't conform `View` protocol. To solve it, we implement it and return `Never` for the body:

```swift
extension ActionSheet.Button: View {

    public var body: Never {
        fatalError()
    }
}
```

Because we don't use `ForEach` for rendering, the body will never be called. And it works now!

```swift
ForEach(["üßÖ", "üßÑ"], id: \.self) { string in
	ActionSheet.Button.default(Text(string)) {
		ingredients.append(string)
	}
}
```

We can explicitly add ids like in the example, use `Identifiable` array or even ranges inside `ForEach`. The downside of this trick is that we can accidentally use `ActionSheet.Button` inside any body and get `fatalError` in runtime.

## Conclusion

Result builder is a great enhancement in Swift language. In certain cases, it improves code readability dramatically. If you want to play with the example, check [ResultBuilderExample](https://github.com/artemnovichkov/ResultBuilderExample) repo.
